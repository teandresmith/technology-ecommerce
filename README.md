Check below for details relating to features that are implemented within Technology ECommerce.

## Authentication/Authorization

With the use of JWTs, there are routes that are properly protected so user profile data remains secure.

## User Profile

Within the User Profile menu, an user can change their login information, default shipping address, and view all of their past orders.

## Product Filtering/Sorting

In the product store, users are able to filter products by their brands, classification, and price. At the same time, these lists can be sorted by price and alphabetical order.

## Payment Handling

Payment is all handled through the use of the Stripe API. In Technology ECommerce, the payment is only a test endpoint so the card information provided within the screen must be used in order to be successfully complete the checkout process.
